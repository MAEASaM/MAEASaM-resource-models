# MAEASaM Resource Models

This repository contains JSON resource models for the MAEASaM (Mapping Africa's Endangered Archaeological Sites and Monuments) project, designed for use with the Arches platform. These models define the core data structures for representing archaeological sites, actors, chronology, information, remote sensing, and administrative boundaries within the MAEASaM Arches instance.

## Usage

### Importing Resource Models into Arches

1. **Download the Models:**
   - Clone this repository or download the individual JSON files you need.

2. **Access Arches Management Console:**
   - Log in to your Arches instance with admin privileges.

3. **Import Models:**
   - Navigate to the *Resource Models* section.
   - Use the "Import" function to upload each JSON file (e.g., `Actor.json`, `Site.json`, etc.).
   - Follow the prompts to complete the import process for each model.

4. **Verify Models:**
   - After importing, check that each model appears in the list and is correctly configured.
